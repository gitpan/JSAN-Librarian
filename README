NAME
    JSAN::Librarian - JavaScript::Librarian adapter for a JSAN installation

DESCRIPTION
    JavaScript::Librarian works on the concept of "libraries" of JavaScript
    files each of which may depend on other files to be loaded before them.

    "JSAN::Librarian" provides a mechanism for detecting and indexing a
    JavaScript::Librarian::Library object for a JSAN installation.

METHODS
  make_index $lib [, $index_file ]
    The "make_index" static method scans an installed JSAN lib tree and
    builds a Config::Tiny index containing the file-level dependency
    information for the files in the library.

    The first parameter should be the root path of the library, with an
    optional second parameter of the index file to write to. If not
    provided, the index file will be written at "$lib/.openjsan.deps".

    Returns true on succuess, or throws an exception on error.

  build_index $lib
    The "build_index" method implements the same functionality as the main
    "make_index" method, except that it takes only the lib path, and returns
    the Config::Tiny object directly, instead of writing it to the index
    file.

    Returns a Config::Tiny object, or throws an exception on error.
